## Difficulties
1. Stuck when computer complete their move and change to player turn
    - Redesign the logically workflow by writing on paper
2. Tried to use count to control computer and player turn. But the count seems not update correctly
    - Using the remaining position length to determine. odd number will be player and even number will be computer
